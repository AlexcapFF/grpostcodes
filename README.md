# grpostcodes
A mapping of Greek postal codes to territory and approximate latitude-longitude coordinates of their centre

## Motivation

Mapping geo-tagged data often requires the ability to group by, or search by postal code. Unfortunately, official sources in Greece do not offer a latitude-longitude representation of the postal code, nor do they map it to a known territory (e.g., according to Kapodistrias official names). This project performed lookups via Google Maps and other public services to create a (hopefully complete) list of postal codes and their coordinates.
